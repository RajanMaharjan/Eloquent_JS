You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N), similar to how you get its length with "s".length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.
Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.
Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.


Hints:
A loop in your function will have to look at every character in the string by running an index from zero to one below its length (< string.length). If the character at the current position is the same as the one the function is looking for, it adds 1 to a counter variable. Once the loop has finished, the counter can be returned.
Take care to make all the variables used in the function local to the function by using the var keyword.

Solution:
function countChar(string, ch) {
  var counted = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++)
    if (string.charAt(i) == ch)
      counted += 1;
  return counted;
}

function countBs(string) {
  return countChar(string, "B");
}

console.log(countBs("BBC"));
// → 2
console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"));
// → 4
